			<p>Hey, I'm Curtis Thompson. I'm a programmer, student, world-renowned mastermind, 100m world record holder... Well, the first two are true! I love to take on new challenges, so through the projects and notes on this website you can see a few of those challenges that I have taken on. I am a student at the University of Warwick, currently studying my MEng Computer Science degree - amongst many other things.</p>
			<p>My main programming languages are currently Python and Java although I do have experience in other languages such as C#, Pascal/Delphi, and Javascript, as well as being able to pick up new programming languages quickly. I work on a variety of projects from games to machine learning. My ideal project, however, is one that both challenges me and incorporates one of my other interests.</p>
			<p>So based upon that you can probably guess my interests are not just computer-related. In my spare time I enjoy running - my half marathon personal best is currently 1:36:50, and in 2019 I completed the Berlin Marathon. I am also a keen lover of nature, having previously volunteered to work with animals such as elephants and monkeys, as well as volunteering to help remove local invasive plant species. And finally, I am an avid Leicester City supporter who are without a doubt the greatest football team to grace the Earth.</p>
