				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">Why was this program developed?</div>
				<div id="spoiler1" class="spoiler">This program was developed as part of my A2 Computing coursework, I needed to create a real program for a real person so developed this Maths Revision Tool for my friend.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">Can I see the written parts of your coursework?</div>
				<div id="spoiler2" class="spoiler">The written part of my coursework (with sensitive details removed) can be found <a href="Main Project.pdf" id="TextLink">by clicking here</a>, or <a href="User Manual.pdf" id="TextLink">here for the user manual</a>. If you are doing coursework for a computing or computer science course please do not plagarise my work, however I have made the <a href="https://github.com/CurtisThompson/Maths-Revision-Tool" id="TextLink">source code available on GitHub here.</a></div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">How did you create this program?</div>
				<div id="spoiler3" class="spoiler">The Maths Revision Tool was developed in Delphi, with an IDE I can only use at college (meaning no all-nighters were pulled in the making of this program).</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">I have a question about using the program. Help!</div>
				<div id="spoiler4" class="spoiler">All instructions on how to use the Maths Revision tool can be found in the user manual <a href="User Manual.pdf" id="TextLink">by clicking here</a>. I do have a contact page on the site if you have questions you simply cannot find the answer to.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">Can I view the source code?</div>
				<div id="spoiler5" class="spoiler"><a href="https://github.com/CurtisThompson/Maths-Revision-Tool" id="TextLink">The source code has been made available on GitHub here.</a></div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">I want to use parts of your code, can I?</div>
				<div id="spoiler6" class="spoiler">Yes, feel free to use any parts of my code in any of your projects, but please credit me in your work for any parts that you do use (Curtis Thompson). Remember that if you are using parts of the code for coursework at school, college or university you will be disqualified for not crediting me (or the authors of any other code that you use) as it is plagiarism. But I have no problem with you using it.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">If you could change any part of the program, what would you change?</div>
				<div id="spoiler7" class="spoiler">There are several things I would like to change if I could go back to them...</div>
