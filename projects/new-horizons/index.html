				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What was your role in the development of New Horizons?</div>
				<div id="spoiler1" class="spoiler">My main role was as project manager of a team of six. As project manager I led the weekly team meetings, planned the progress of the team to ensure we met set deadlines, and communicated progress with the customer and supervisor. As Chief Tester and Evaluator I performed various forms of testing and planned the final study evaluation (which included gaining ethical approval from the university).</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">How did you evaluate the success of the game?</div>
				<div id="spoiler2" class="spoiler">The success of the game was evaluated by performing a study in a local school. Students were asked to play the game for up to half an hour, then their Computer Science knowledge was compared before and after playing the game. Due to the short timeframe of the study no statistical significance was found, however it would be expected for a longer study. Study questionnaires showed that 86% of students would like to see a game like this used in their school lessons, and 67% belived their knowledge increased during the 30 minutes of gameplay.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">How did you ensure that the data collection was done in an ethical manner?</div>
				<div id="spoiler3" class="spoiler">To ensure data was collected in an ethical manner we decided to gain ethical approval from one of the university's ethics committees. This involved planning the study ahead of time with the participant's concerns in mind. We had to make sure that software used complied with GDPR, as well as ensure that participants were aware of the data and interaction involved. We successfully gained ethical approval before beginning the study, which meant that we were confident that we had adequate measures in place.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">In what ways did you test the game prior to final evaluation?</div>
				<div id="spoiler4" class="spoiler">Unit testing was performed within the Unity Engine on each developed puzzle. The results were fed back to the development team so that they could make necessary changes. User testing was also done in the form of 30-90 minute sessions with participants who were unfamiliar with the topics taught in the game to see how users would interact, providing valuable feedback to the development team. All of this testing was performed prior to the final study.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What skills did you learn or improve during this project?</div>
				<div id="spoiler5" class="spoiler">As this was a large group project it allowed me to develop some skills that could not be done with an individual project. We extensively used Git in our development for version control, and I was able to improve my Git skills in this project. Since I was project manager, I was also able to develop soft skills such as instructing other team members as well as long-term planning. These soft skills were also applied to the testing section as I had to hold hour-long one-to-one sessions with individuals to assess how new users used our developed game.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">Was the project a success?</div>
				<div id="spoiler6" class="spoiler">Our group achieved 13 of the 19 initial requirements as agreed with our project customer. The project customer and project supervisor were also satisfied with the final game that we developed. With regards to the study, we found that 86% of students would like to see a game like this used in their school lessons, and 67% belived their knowledge increased during the 30 minutes of gameplay. Although no statistical significance in test scores was found due to the limited size of the study, the results were positive enough to suggest that a larger study may be able to find significant improvement.</div>
