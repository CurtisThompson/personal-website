				<h2>Questions</h2>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What is the IBM Data Science Specialisation?</div>
				<div id="spoiler1" class="spoiler">The IBM Data Science Specialisation is a group of courses offered on Coursera by IBM designed to teach you all of the basic data science topics that you would be required to know to get a job in data science or machine learning.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What courses did you complete?</div>
				<div id="spoiler2" class="spoiler">I had to complete nine different courses:<ol><li>What is Data Science?</li><li>Open Source Tools for Data Science</li><li>Data Science Methodology</li><li>Python for Data Science and AI</li><li>Databases and SQL for Data Science</li><li>Data Analysis with Python</li><li>Data Visualization with Python</li><li>Machine Learning with Python</li><li>Applied Data Science Capstone</li></ol></div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What was the most interesting thing that you learnt?</div>
				<div id="spoiler3" class="spoiler">I went into this course having already used Python, and similarly I had some SQL experience. The most interesting parts of the course were those which I hadn't covered in great detail before. This included the Data Science Methodology course, where I looked at all stages of a data science project from business understanding to deployment.</div>
				<div class="spoiler-button spoilerbutton">What was the Luxembourg towns project?</div>
				<div id="spoiler4" class="spoiler">The Luxembourg towns project was my final project of the course. The overall aim of this project was to compare the twelve towns of Luxembourg and find those which are most similar to each other. To do this I collected statistical and factual data from Wikipedia, and I collected venue data from the Foursquare API. This data was cleaned so that it could be used in an exploratory data analysis. The final steps of the project involved creating a distance matrix which could be used for finding similar towns - this similarity matrix was used to identify four unique groups within the twelve towns.</div>
