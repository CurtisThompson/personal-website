				<p>The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate is a course designed to teach all of the important data science skills that you need to know to make you job-ready. There are several hands-on assignments, and a big project at the end (in which I looked at the towns of Luxembourg – but that is a different conversation). In the first few months of this year I have been taking on this professional certificate, and I’ve finally completed it!</p>
                <p>For the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I had to complete nine courses:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What is Data Science? (88%)</li>
                    <li>Open Source Tools for Data Science (96%)</li>
                    <li>Data Science Methodology (97%)</li>
                    <li>Python for Data Science and AI (94%)</li>
                    <li>Databases and SQL for Data Science (93%)</li>
                    <li>Data Analysis with Python (94%)</li>
                    <li>Data Visualisation with Python (90%)</li>
                    <li>Machine Learning with Python (100%)</li>
                    <li>Applied Data Science Capstone (99%)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>My scores on each course were very high, it was only the first course where I scored below 90%. The marking for some of the courses is a bit unusual though. In some courses you are doing quizzes which are marked instantly, but in some courses, you are being marked by other people taking the course. Are they scoring you too high? Too low? Nevertheless, my marks were consistently high, so I am not too worried.</p>
                <p>I also feel like I have learnt a lot from the certificate. In a typical university or Kaggle project you just think about doing some analysis, visualisation, and then create a load of machine learning models. The data science methodology course explains everything from business understanding to deployment, far more than just your normal home projects.</p>
                <p>That being said, those three courses before the capstone has a lot of content that I was already familiar with. I have done analysis and created models before. In terms of having enough knowledge to get a job, I would say they are my strongest areas. I don’t use SQL as often as I would like so that would be one area I could improve on – but with the help of Google I can solve many SQL problems thrown at me.</p>
                <p>But what would I like to improve on the most? I would love to work more on my visualisation skills. Being able to tell a story is a huge part of data science, and visualisation are a main part of that. I have used matplotlib a lot, and I have experience with seaborn and plotly, but there is still so much more that I can learn.</p>
                <p>All-in-all, it was a great experience doing the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. I have learnt a lot. Hopefully, it has made me more job-ready too!</p>
