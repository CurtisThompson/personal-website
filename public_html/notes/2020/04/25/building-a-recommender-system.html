				<p>The most popular websites and apps nowadays will be making use of some sort of recommender system. Facebook recommends new friends to add or events to attend, Netflix recommends new movies to watch, and Spotify recommends music to listen to based upon your current habits.</p>

                <p>One of the most frequent uses of recommender systems is by news websites and blogs. You will read an article or post and at the bottom there will be a group of similar articles that you might enjoy. The benefit for you is that you find more relevant content, and the website receives more interacts and page views. These websites are making use of content-based recommender systems to find pages similar to the one you are viewing, and that is what I wanted to try and make for my website.</p>
                
                <p>So, my goal is this article to create a system that can recommend three articles on my website with similar content to any article that I input.</p>
                
                <h2>Gathering My Dataset</h2>
                
                <p>Since the dataset consists of pages on my website, I do not really need to gather it in the same way I would for other projects. The only thing there is for me to do is to extract the relevant information from each article; the title, the meta tags, and the textual content. To do this, we use the BeautifulSoup package in Python. The data is then loaded into a Pandas dataframe.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Initial data" src="initial_data.png" />
        		    <p>The initially collected data for each article on my website.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <h2>Preprocessing</h2>
                
                <p>There are four main steps of preprocessing that we use on the data (after tokenisation of course). The main reason for this preprocessing step is to remove the different formats that words can be in (so that if we have a word, we can recognise it as the same word in every instance). Three of the four steps concern this; conversion to lowercase, removing punctuation, and removing whitespace. These preprocessing steps should be sufficient to deal with that problem. The other preprocessing step involves removing stopwords, as these will occur in most articles, so we don't need to detect them. After preprocessing we return the words in a list.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Preprocessed data" src="preprocessing.png" />
        		    <p>The features are performing preprocessing steps.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <h2>Conversion To A Single Feature</h2>
                
                <p>After data preprocessing we want to combine these words into a single feature that can be compared for each article to check similarity. Firstly, we create a bag-of-words feature from our three features. This is as simple as combining each feature list. However, comparing this single feature between articles when the list consists of words is not easy. So, we need to convert the lists to a vector using sklearn's CountVectorizer.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Bag of words feature" src="bag-of-words.png" />
        		    <p>Each URL with it's single bag of words feature.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <h2>Cosine Similarity</h2>
                
                <p>How do we know if two articles are similar? After all this work it is actually quite simple. We will use cosine similarity to compare articles, which can be done with sklearn's cosine_similarity function. This produces a similarity matrix for all articles. For any given article, the highest value will match it to itself, as any article is identical to itself. The next three highest values for any given article will be the three most similar articles. We can use this to make article recommendations.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Cosine similarity matrix" src="cosine-similarity.png" />
        		    <p>A section of the cosine similarity matrix used to compare the similarity of articles.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <p>It is useful to have a quick look, to make sure recommendations are what we would expect. I fed it the URL to an article about my work with Warwick Students' Union, and it recommended three other articles about the same work. When I gave it an article about my A-Level maths notes I got three articles about A-Levels. One more try. I gave it an article about my app, Word Blitz. The two most similar articles are the other two articles I wrote about the app. The third recommendation is about an AI I coded four years ago. No completely strange recommendations, I would say it is working.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Example recommendation" src="recommendations.png" />
        		    <p>When a Warwick SU article is given as input, three other Warwick SU articles are recommended.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <h2>Using It On The Website</h2>
                
                <p>Done? Not quite. Now these recommendations need to be loaded onto the websites so that they can be used. The easiest way is to output a csv file with three recommendations for each article. This can then be read by the website so that recommendations are seen by the user. And with that, the recommendation system is complete.</p>
