				<p>I'm currently on the hunt for a graduate job in the time of a coronavirus pandemic, so I need every help I can get in recruiters spotting me and businesses wanting me. For anyone wanting a technical job, LinkedIn is their central hub for getting employed. One page with what is essentially your CV, and it is there for all recruiters to see. If this is the case, then I really need to make my profile stand out. One of the ways I can do that is with LinkedIn Assessments.</p>
                <p>A LinkedIn Assessment is a 15 to 20-minute multiple choice test which relates to one of the skills listed on your profile. If you pass then the skill gets a little badge next to it on your profile, suggesting that you have some level of proficiency in that skill. As I was cleaning up my profile, I noticed that I could take these tests for a few of my skills, so I had a go. This article explains a little bit about each test and my experiences with them.</p>
                <p>As a quick side note, if you are reading this and want to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/curtis-comp-sci/">check out my LinkedIn profile then you can do so here.</a></p>

                <h2>Python (Programming Language)</h2>
                <p>The first test that I took. I have been using Python now for approximately two years, mostly in a data science context as opposed to a development context. However, my third-year project was largely completed in Python, so I have used the language for developing software.</p>
                <p>This test seemed to be quite focused on data structures and runtime complexities of functions (both built-in and user defined functions). If you have taken an algorithm or data structure university module then you should be fine with a lot of these questions. Some are Python specific such as the runtime of accessing a value in a dictionary via the key being O(1) - but even that could be guessed.</p>
                <p>I was presented with Python code for perhaps three or four questions, but the code was not difficult. The only Python module referenced in the quiz was sys. I presume it only mentions standard libraries in questions. All in all, not a too difficult quiz if you have been using Python for a while but a beginner would struggle.</p>
                
                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <p>Theoretically I should be able to pass this test as I have been teaching web development technologies to students at university this year. You would expect your tutor to be able to get above the 70th percentile on this test.</p>
                <p>The content of this test actually goes beyond anything that we taught to the students this year. None of it is difficult, it is just a question of whether you have seen what they are asking you. Every question relates to a certain tag or attributes for that tag. Tags in this quiz which we had never mentioned to students include aside and address - while one question also expected me to know every attribute that you can use on a textarea. To be honest, I guessed a couple of questions, but I managed to pull through and pass the test.</p>
                
                <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
                Did you think the HTML test was hard? Well, perhaps it was, this CSS test was much easier. One question required me to know how to use a fixed position, and for another I needed to know how to use an absolute position. I also had to know how use different selectors for classes, ids, and elements. These are all content that we had to teach to students during tutoring. So, either that means a university web development course teaches you a lot, or this test was easy.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't rate my CSS skills as better than my Python skills, but this test felt easy for me. It may just be that LinkedIn tests are not difficult.</p>
                
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>How easy are these tests? Well I will find out by doing the Java assessment. I haven't used a lot of Java in the past 2 years besides a three-month period where I had to teach basic Java to new university students. During that period, I found that I could still remember a lot of the basics, but I am no master (unless you are comparing me to people who are learning for the first time).</p>
                <p>One thing that makes this test harder than the others is that it involves reading and dry running a lot of code. You only have 90 seconds for each question too, so you better be fast at it. On one question I wasn't fast enough, and it said I was out of time. Nevertheless, I somehow managed to pass the assessment - and now I am LinkedIn certified on my profile.</p>
                
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I went on to complete further assessments in JavaScript and PHP, so overall I managed to complete 6 different LinkedIn assessments in the space of 2 hours. I would not consider myself I master in any of the skills that I assessed myself in today, but I am familiar with each of the technologies. Python is possibly my strongest of the six - although HTML is never a difficult skill (it just requires memorisation of tags and attributes. If somebody came to me and said they had passed a LinkedIn assessment of a skill then I would recognise that they have some familiarity with it, but it doesn't mean they would be job ready. You can't get a true picture of their skills in a 15-minute assessment. It does look nice on my profile though.</p>
