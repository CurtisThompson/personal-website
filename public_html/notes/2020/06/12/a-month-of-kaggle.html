				<p>Every day for the past month I have been active on the data science website Kaggle. I have either made a submission to a competition, run a public kernel script, or commented on someone else’s work (often I do more than one of these things). In the past month I’ve also competed in two competitions as well as earned two bronze notebook medals and fourteen bronze discussion medals. Doing data science every day, I have learnt a few things along the way. I just wanted to run through a few of these things in this article.</p>
                <h2>Imbalanced Learning</h2>
                <p>The first competition I competed in was the Killer Shrimp Invasion challenge, where you must predict the presence of killer shrimp in the Baltic Sea. One of the main issues with the competition dataset as well as real life problem data is the class imbalance. In the competition dataset there was only 50 positive instances of killer shrimp across 300,000 data points. There is where the imblearn package become useful.</p>
                <p>With the imblearn package you can run several different algorithms to either reduce the number of majority instances (in this case, negative instances), or to increase the number of minority instances. The simplest of these would be the RandomUnderSampler. However, removing at random is not the best strategy for preserving information in the dataset, so other methods such as AllKNN and TomekLinks also exist.</p>
                <p>For oversampling, a RandomOverSampler also exists. Again, this may not be preferred, and so several SMOTE based algorithms exist for increase the number of minority instances. While imblearn is for a very specific problem, it was extremely useful for dealing with the class imbalance.</p>
                <h2>Seaborn, Plotly, Folium…</h2>
                <p>The standard data visualisation library is matplotlib, and it is the one I am most familiar with. But there are also a huge number of other libraries that can be used for visualisation – many are arguably better than matplotlib. Some of my public kernels were experiments with other packages; namely seaborn, plotly, and folium.</p>
                <p>Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib. It allows you to create elegant plots more simply, while you can still fall back on matplotlib if you need to make a minor change. Plotly is another package that offers similar plots to seaborn and matplotlib, but one huge advantage is that it can be used to easily create interactive plots; I used it to create a choropleth map of US police shootings. Folium is a niche package, and specifically focuses on interactive leaflet maps – which I used in plotting a map of volcanoes and tectonic plate boundaries across the world.</p>
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Map of volcanoes and tectonic plates" src="volcano-map.png" />
        		    <p>A map of volcanoes and tectonic plates that I created with Folium.</p>
        		</div>
                <p>Each serves their purpose, so I think it is best to learn how to use many data visualisation packages, so the right one is always within reach.</p>
                <h2>NLP Transformers</h2>
                <p>Currently I am in the final days of the Tweet Sentiment Extraction competition. It is unusual in that we are given a tweet and a sentiment, and we must extract the section of the tweet that best highlights the given sentiment. It is not your typical classification or regression problem.</p>
                <p>The top models in the competition (based on what can be seen so far) use transformer models such as BERT or roBERTa. We convert the tweet into tokens and then use roBERTa (which contains a neural network) to select a start and end token that encapsulates our prediction. This is far more complicated than anything I have done so far, and I expect I will do a lot more learning once the top models are publicly released at the end of the competition. For now, I am hovering around the top 20%.</p>
