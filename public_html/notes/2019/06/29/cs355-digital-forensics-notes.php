        		<p>These are my notes for the CS355 Digital Forensics module at my university. Having sat the exam and completed all of the labs for the module this year, I managed to score 75% (a first class) in this module - so it is fair to say I did very well. Overall, the module mostly covers techniques relating to image forensics, but also briefly looks at video forensics as well. Although other types such as audio are mentioned, they are not really looked at in this module.</p>

        		<ul>
        			<li>Image Acquisition</li>
        			<li>Image Representation</li>
        			<li>Comparing Images</li>
        			<li>Frequency Domain</li>
        			<li>Spacial and Frequency Enhancements</li>
        			<li>Digital Watermarking</li>
        			<li>JPEG Compression</li>
        			<li>Compression-Based Forensics</li>
        			<li>Circular Shift and Match</li>
        			<li>Feature Matching</li>
        			<li>Video Forensics</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I have some basic knowledge on computer security and was expecting it to be useful in this module, but the content was very different from my expectations. Despite this, I found the content both interesting and exciting. Being able to combine the contents on this module with others in the lab was possibly one of the most interesting and useful moments in the course. We used basic machine learning techniques to identify a source camera using sensor pattern noise. Our application appeared very successful, but not good enough to be used in court. Although most of what I learnt in this module may not directly be used again, I feel as though knowing the image acquisition and representation facts will be very useful at some point in the future.</p>
