        		<p>Well... week 4! What a week this was. This week I was tasked with a lot of coding of pages. But I wasn't doing ordinary coding with HTML and CSS, I was coding pages with Javascript.</p>
        		<p>So let me explain. I was adding and removing static elements to pages. This is something you really should be doing in HTML but, long story short, there are some pages on the website that we cannot edit the HTML for. This means we have to attach scripts that will do the extra HTML we cannot add normally. Remember that this website is being redesigned so some pages will have completely different elements. Yeah it was always going to be a long task.</p>
        		<p>Why is it bad to do this? I suppose the first issue is that if the elements of the page need changing in the future it is very complex for the developer working on the task. If all the elements are in the HTML code then it is simple to change them, but if they are coming from some of the many Javascript files that are attached to the page then the developer may need to check through all of these scripts to do what they need to do. And finding the specific statements that are making these changes is not always easy too (especially if you didn't write the code). On top of this, there is always the issue of people who disable Javascript - but it is impossible with a site like this to perfectly cater for all these people.</p>
        		<p>There are definitely advantages from a personal point of view to what I had to do this week. I feel as though this is the week where I have learnt the most, so far anyway. I am having to remember Javascript statements and methods that I have not used often or used a long time ago, as well as learning new ones, as many of the things I am doing will apply to very specific situations. I have also learnt a lot about CSS. When you are learning web development as part of your degree you learn very basic CSS and are then expected to search on the internet for anything extra you want to do. In a job like this, you need to know specific things you wouldn't have been taught in your degree.</p>
        		<p>Here is a list of a few things I either had to remember or learn:</p>
        		<ul>
        		    <li>.before() and .after() can be used to add HTML before and after an element, while .append() and prepend() can be used to put HTML inside the element</li>
        		    <li>.appendTo() and .prependTo() are extra methods to move an element within another element</li>
        		    <li>.parent() and .children() allow you to access the parent and children of an element</li>
        		    <li>If your selection returns multiple individual elements, you can use a function for each occurance with .each(function(e){...})</li>
        		    <li>a[href *= "thing"] is a CSS selector that returns all links where the URL contains the string "thing" (you can use other elements too)</li>
        		    <li>p:contains("text") is a CSS selector that returns all p elements that have "text" within the inner text of the element (you can use other elements too)</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>There are many more little tricks that I learnt this week too, but these were some of the ones that I used most often (and will probably use often in the future).</p>
        		<p>I would say that this week has been very beneficial to my learning experience. Perhaps if the system was set up better then I would have been able to complete the work in an easier way (editing just HTML), but then I wouldn't have learnt as much as I did. While this is important to me, it is also important that we manage to get the site live at the right time so hopefully I don't need to do anything as complex for the remaining pages (it is likely that I will for one or two, but not many).</p>
