        		<p>These are my notes for the CS342 Machine Learning module at my university. Now when I upload all of my notes for all of my modules this year I get to talk about the high score I managed to achieve in each of those modules. With Machine Learning I don't get to do that, as I only managed 52% in this module. But that doesn't mean I regret taking the module, and it certainly doesn't mean I didn't learn anything. Having a chance to reflect upon my experiences in this module, I might even say the opposite; this is the module I'm the happiest I took, and the one I learnt the most from.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in this module include:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Linear Regression</li>
        			<li>Decision Trees</li>
        			<li>kNN Models</li>
        			<li>Artificial Neural Networks</li>
        			<li>Deep Learning</li>
        			<li>Maximum Likelihood</li>
        			<li>Bayesian Inference</li>
        			<li>K-Means Clustering</li>
        			<li>Principal Component Analysis</li>
        			<li>Overfitting</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>Almost all of the content in this module was new to me. It was even a different area of Computer Science that I was not used to, so I had to do some refreshers on matrices just to be able to understand content at the start of this module. We looked heavily at supervised learning at the beginning of this module, which includes models such as kNN and decision trees. My favourite machine learning algorithm from the module was the k-means algorithm, just for its simplicity (it is even an unsupervised algorithm, so there is no need for all of the data to already be classified). All of these models were new to me so it took me a while to understand each of them, and then even longer to understand the situations were I might prefer one model to another. I am still not an expert with that, but having a better understanding of the maths behind these models surely helps.</p>
        		<p>We didn't just look at the maths of the models. In the labs we practised using these models with Python and scikit-learn. Having a working knowledge of Python definitely made things easier here. One of the courseworks involved competing in a competition on Kaggle - the data science website. Now this is incredibly deflating when you have spent a month or two learning about this for the first time and then you are competing directly against people with years of experience. But at the same time, I was able to learn a lot through Kaggle and it is something I will be using again in the future. For the record, I did not do very well in that competition but I did get above 60% in that particular coursework.</p>
        		<p>I've only had a brief introduction to machine learning through this module (and I attempted to use parts of it in my dissertation), and from my final score in the module it looks like I didn't perform amazingly. But I definitely learnt a lot from taking this module, and I know I want to keep looking more into machine learning. Perhaps I will even take part in another Kaggle competition.</p>
