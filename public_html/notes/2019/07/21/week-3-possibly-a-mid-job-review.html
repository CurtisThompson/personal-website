        		<p>To the end of week 3, where my job should be half way complete, and I've spent half of my time working on the project. It seems like a perfect point for a review with my line manager and the department manager.</p>
        		<p>First we had a look through the work that I had completed so far. A lot of my work so far had involved checking pages and flagging them up on the testing report, so we looked through the report to see what issues had been found. My line manager also had a few issues to raise and wanted to see if I had spotted them as well. We could then discuss ways that these issues could be solved.</p>
        		<p>This discussion (solving the issues) was very beneficial as it gave me a chance to contribute to a meeting and voice my opinion, but also to see how someone with a lot of work experience would go about solving some of these problems. There were some that I came up with good solutions, and some where my line manager came up with good solutions. Overall, we came up with solutions for many of the main issues.</p>
        		<p>They also wanted to discuss things about me personally. This sounds scary... This sounds bad... But no, it was a lot of positive feedback about how I had dealt with coming into the organisation. They told me that I was very professional, and that they had also received good feedback from other people within the organisation that I had come across in the first few weeks. They also mentioned that I was able to fit into the team very well.</p>
        		<p>Finally, on top of this feedback they wanted to offer me a few extra weeks at the organisation. So my job was meant to last 6 weeks (making this the mid-job review), but they wanted to offer me an extra two weeks on top of this so that I could be around when the website goes live. Of course I said yes! I think those final weeks will be some of the most interesting, as we will get real feedback from real users. It's not too far away if you think about it.</p>
