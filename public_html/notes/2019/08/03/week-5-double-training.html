        		<p>So we are scarily close to the launch of the website now. The end of this week means there is now less than two weeks to go until the planned launch date. At this point you would expect that the majority of pages have been coded, and you are now looking to fix any remaining bugs/errors/issues within the pages. Fortunately for us, this is roughly where we are at.</p>
        		<p>My last major pages to code were some of the hardest. As I mentioned last week, there are some pages that we simply have to code large chunks in JavaScript. This continued again this week with some more pages. Once you get into the rhythm of doing everything in JavaScript it does become slightly easier, but I wish it could just be HTML/CSS coding on these pages (as it should be).</p>
        		<p>The standout part of this week was leading two training sessions for staff members to get used to the system. Unlike the last session I did, I've now had five weeks to get used to the system - which feels like enough to teach others who will need basic permissions.</p>
        		<p>When doing the training, it is important to consider lots of different factors such as; what do they need to know, what do they already know, what is their technical ability, which methods of performing tasks will satisfy their needs, and in what environment do they normally work in. This list could stretch for miles, but even considering these few will make the training more efficient.</p>
        		<p>The first training session was directed at people who didn't need to perform a lot of actions on the system, and didn't have high technical abilities (or so we thought - one later admitted they had used HTML in the past, so maybe could do some more advanced methods). Knowing this, we can cater the training around these needs, and explain things in ways that they will understand. Although I say this, it is also important not to treat anyone as though they are stupid or incompetent.</p>
        		<p>The second training was with people who had more technical ability and a greater understanding of the system. Therefore, we could ask them which parts of the training they are familiar with and get through them quicker (but stopping if they had any questions). It also meant they would have more questions at the end as they would want to delve a little deeper, but that's fine and it is something you can prepare for.</p>
        		<p>It is important to prepare for these training sessions. They were only scheduled for an hour so having a bullet point plan helps a lot to stay on track and to cover all the content. But at the same time, it is important to be able to adapt to different situations, as each training session could be unique.</p>
        		<p>As we get towards the end of the week, we are getting to the point where I'm now working from bullet points and emails. This is because there are few major tasks, and I've just got a list of loads of minor tasks to complete. This is how I expect the next week to go as well, but we will have to wait and see.</p>
