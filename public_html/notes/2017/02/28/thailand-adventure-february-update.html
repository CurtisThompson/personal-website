        		<p>February has been an interesting month for my Elephant and Hill Tribes challenge.</p>
        		<p>Towards the start of February I signed up to another challenge called Warwick LOST 2017, which sounds like a horrible challenge once you know what it is - but I am doing it to raise awareness of my main challenge and to raise even more money. On the first Saturday of March I will be kidnapped, blindfolded and taken to a far away location. Without any money, I must make it back to university. I could be stranded hundreds of miles away, but I will do it! By talking to people at university, and by talking to people on my LOST adventure I hope to raise more money for my project.</p>

        		<p>On Saturday 18th March I had another street collection, this time in Birmingham. Birmingham is a much larger city than any of the other places in which I have collected money for charity. And it is very hard. I initially positioned myself in one of the busiest streets but collecting was very hard and the people who passed me were not very nice. To try and make things better I repositioned myself but the collecting did not go much better there either. All of the other people collecting on the day (and the weekend after) said that Birmingham didn't seem to be very charitable. I don't know whether it is Birmingham or large cities in general, but it wasn't a good collection.</p>

        		<p>Raffle! I have started an online raffle to get some sort of passive income for the charity. Tickets cost a pound, the more tickets sold, the more prizes that get put into the prize pot. If you want to enter the raffle, <a href="http://www.cwthompson.com/elephant" class="NotesUnderline">click here.</a> I have made it so that the raffle ends at the end of my university's term - as it is a convenient time for most people who will enter the raffle (as they'll be from my university).</p>
        		<p>I am also planning a movie night with some other people from the project - which will take place in March. One great piece of news from February is that I am ahead of many other people from my university in the project, and our university is doing far better than the average. There is still a long way to go though!</p>
