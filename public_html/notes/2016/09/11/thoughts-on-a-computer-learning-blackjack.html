		        <p>In a few weeks I will be starting university. I received a welcome letter from the Computer Science department recently and they say that getting used to using Java would be useful, but you do not need any programming experience at the start of the course. Yeah, to me that means I am going to spend the next few weeks having fun by messing around in Java. I hadn't worked on an AI project in a while so I thought I'd look at interesting ways of completing a simple task, playing Blackjack.</p>
		        <p>Coding a game where the user plays against the AI dealer in Blackjack is not hard, I've already done that in Java. Now I am looking at how an AI could be implemented to make the dealer harder to play against. The purpose of this is not to find the optimum way of playing, but just to see a few different tactics that a computer can use which are easy for a programmer to implement.</p>
		        <br />
		    	<p><strong>Learning From The Dealer's Hand</strong><br /><br />An easy and quick way to find a tactic for the AI would be to let it simulate though a few thousand games so that it can calculate where the ideal score would be to stop. The highest score before going bust is the ideal score to get, so simulating a few thousand games would be easy to find that score. The lowest score where the probability of going bust is over 50% is where the AI would stick. Other values could be used instead of 50%.</p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>Learning From All Hands</strong><br /><br />Another way instead of just using the dealer's hand would be to play games against the user, and learn from their hands too. This would be slower than simulating thousands of games as it requires user input, but you will be able to see the AI learning across many games, and it will take into account the player that the AI is against so should give it a better chance of winning.</p>
				<br />
		    	<p><strong>Card Counting</strong><br /><br />Providing the deck is properly implemented, the same card should not appear more than once. When deciding whether to stick or get another card this is actually very important as it affects the chance of going bust. If an AI was able to card count, remember past cards to determine what is left in the deck, it could lower the risk of going bust - giving it a further advantage against a player.</p>
				<br />
				<p><strong>Calculating Probabilities</strong><br /><br />The two methods of learning would be expected to give similar values to those that could be calculated by a mathematician. An AI could choose not to learn, and instead just calculate the probability. If the AI was to learn, it could just learn from the player's hand and therefore get a probability that the user has gone bust or gained a high score, then using the previously calculated probabilities to decide whether to stick.</p>
				<br />
				<p><br />There are many methods that could be tested, however I am attempting to keep the programming in this as simple as possible. All of these methods could realistically be implemented by anyone with little programming experience (but the code would probably be longer than they are used to) as they require only basic knowledge. Probabilities will also require some mathematical knowledge but besides that they are not hard. As I am "learning" some Java before university starts I may try to implement one or two of these. I will update with my progress once I do.</p>
