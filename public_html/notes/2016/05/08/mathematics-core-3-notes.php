        		<p>Core 3 is the first A2 mathematics module. It expands on a lot of information that should have been learnt in the AS modules, but also introduces three new trigonometric functions and a few rules when differentiating more complex functions. Overall if you are comfortable with the AS modules it should not be too hard to complete this module. You can download my handwritten notes from this page.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Algebraic Fractions</li>
        			<li>Functions</li>
        			<li>Exponential Functions</li>
        			<li>Numerical Methods</li>
        			<li>Graph Transformations</li>
        			<li>Secant, Cosecant and Cotangent</li>
        			<li>Trigonometric Identities</li>
        			<li>Differentiation Chain Rule</li>
        			<li>Differentiation Product Rule</li>
        			<li>Differentiation Quotient Rule</li>
        			<li>Differentiating Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</li>
        			<li>Differentiating Trigonometric Functions</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>Remember these are my revision notes. I've sat this exam before and I'm studying all of the further pure modules so these notes may not have enough information for everybody (although I hope they would as you should have learnt everything already and be using these for revision). Practice questions are important too so get started and use these notes when stuck.</p>
