        		<p>To what extent can the processes of artificial intelligence be considered actual intelligence?</p>
        			
        		<p>That is the one question I attempted to answer during my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ). It was not an easy task. I had to plan my project, complete all of the research and write out the thousands of words myself. After this six month project I ended with an A* grade (as an A-Level) and a huge report which only sort of answers the question. Would I do it again? Definitely, but probably with a different question. I thought in this article I would talk a bit about my experiences during the EPQ, and a bit about my project in particular.</p>
        		
        		<p><a href="Final.pdf">To read my EPQ report click here.</a></p>
        		
        		<h2>The Processes of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        		
        		<div class="captioned-image">
        			<img alt="Panda Chatterbot" src="panda-chatterbot.png" />
        			<p>A chatterbot I made, I'm sure this one doesn't display much intelligence.</p>
        		</div>
        		
        		<p>To answer the question, my project goes through a few different philosophical and practical examples that have came up in artificial intelligence discussions over the past 100 years or more. The concept of artificial intelligence or autonomous machines is not new to philosophy and has been discussed for hundreds of years. My project looks at many of these arguments with a closer focus on the Chinese Room Argument and the Turing Test while also talking about how we could know whether a computer has intelligence and how to measure it. The example of chatterbots is linked to the Turing Test and very recent examples (like Eugene Goostman and Cleverbot) are used.</p>
        		
        		<p>My project also looks at what makes up human intelligence, then moving onto artificial neural networks and how they might possibly result in intelligent computers when compared to biological neural networks. I accept that the definition of actual intelligence is the most important factor in whether a computer can actually be intelligent, but a simulation of human intelligence is certainly possible in the near future. Where do you draw the line between a simulation of intelligence and an actual display of intelligence? I could not answer that question, but I make it some way and I would encourage you to read my EPQ report to see what I concluded.</p>
        		
        		<h2>The Extended Project Qualification</h2>
        		
        		<p>I am sure some people will read this wondering whether they should do the EPQ, or a similar qualification. Without a doubt I would say yes. I have learned lots of useful skills from doing this project. The most important skill is probably being able to plan a whole project from the start. I had 6 months to complete this project which may sound like a lot of time to answer one question but if I fell behind for just one week I would have a lot of catching up to do, which would be a struggle. I had to break down the whole project completely to see step-by-step exactly what I was going to do, and estimate how long each one would take. I then added extra time in to catch up on anything which took longer than I originally planned. With this plan I managed to complete my project on time, and to a high quality. This is such a useful skill for me now, I don't just use it for the EPQ, I use it for everything.</p>

        		<div class="captioned-image">
        			<img alt="Panda Chatterbot" src="epq-folder.jpg" />
        			<p>My folder to organise all of my research and notes.</p>
        		</div>
        		
        		<p>The one other major skill I learned was researching. The EPQ is an independent project, you can ask people for help but you are expected to do as much of it as possible by yourself. This was really exciting for me, seeing how good I could actually do on my own as it is something you never really have to do at school and not even so much at college. Going to libraries, watching documentaries and searching for academic reports online. Not to mention being able to keep a bibliography of sources. I learned to do all of that in this EPQ. I haven't started university at this point but I'm pretty sure I will be using them skills at least some of the time.</p>
        		
        		<p>For the EPQ you have to complete two documents. One is totally up to you, answering your question or completing your project. You can choose how to lay it out and what to write about. The other is the project log. You must fill in your project log as you go along, reviewing your progress and talking about what you plan to do at the end. You must also talk about the presentation which you have to do to an audience (sounds scary, but the presentation actually went really well for me). The documents are below:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<a href="Candidate Record Form.pdf"><li>EPQ Project Log</li></a>
        			<a href="Final.pdf"><li>Final Report</li></a>
        		</ul>
        		
        		<p>I hope you enjoy reading my EPQ report. If you are considering the EPQ then I would definitely recommend it. If you have any questions about my project or the EPQ in general please ask below in the comments.</p>
