        		<p>While digging through my old paperwork from my first year at college I found some very old electronics notes which I made around a year and a half ago. It is interesting how some of it links in with physics and computing topics that I do in both my first and second year. It's a shame how I dropped the subject for my second year, although maybe I wouldn't be able to handle the workload with four subjects - one of which I was doing over the one year instead of two. The first year coursework was interesting too, in which I made an electronic fish tank simulation (ignore that it could electrocute fish if it malfunctioned), but it would be hard this year with the huge computing project I had to do. Anyway, these notes which I uncovered cover the first unit of the electronics specification and possibly some of the second unit but I have labelled these notes as unit 1 as that is the main focus.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Logic Gates</li>
        			<li>Truth Tables</li>
        			<li>Boolean Algebra</li>
        			<li>Karnaugh Maps</li>
        			<li>Multiplexers</li>
        			<li>Systems and Devices</li>
        			<li>Pull-Up and Pull-Down Resistors</li>
        			<li>Zener Diodes</li>
        			<li>Flip Flops</li>
        			<li>Transistors</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>My note-taking skills seem to have improved a lot over the past year and a half, I'm sure if I remade the notes now they would look ten times better. But my main thought in uploading them here is that I can throw away the paper copies which I doubt I will ever need again, but they are still available if I do. They are also available to everyone who can reach my site. Perhaps once I am at university they will become useful again.</p>
