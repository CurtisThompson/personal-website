Maybe it is just because Further Pure 1 is so easy." />

        		<p>More A-Level notes! This time I have uploaded my notes for Further Pure 2 Mathematics on the Edexcel specification. Personally I find Further Pure 2 quite a step up from Further Pure 1, and actually find it similar in difficulty to Further Pure 3. This is probably because those two modules are for upper sixth form students so are meant to be more of a challenge, but I don't think the jump up was this big for Core 2 to Core 3. Maybe it is just because Further Pure 1 is so easy.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Inequalities</li>
        			<li>Method of Differences</li>
        			<li>Forms of Complex Numbers</li>
        			<li>De Moivre's Theorem</li>
        			<li>Complex Numbers and Loci</li>
        			<li>First Order Differential Equations</li>
        			<li>Second Order Differential Equations</li>
        			<li>Maclaurin Series</li>
        			<li>Taylor Series</li>
        			<li>Polar Coordinates</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>That is the Further Pure 2 notes completed, now back to revision... The next notes I upload will possibly be either Mechanics or Further Pure 3, both sets of notes are partially completed at this point so it depends which one I choose to do first. I find all three of those modules are about equal difficulty, what about you?</p>
