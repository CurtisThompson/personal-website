			<p>Hey, I'm Curtis Thompson. I'm a data scientist from the United Kingdom. I love to take on new challenges, which you can hopefully see through the projects on this website, GitHub, and Kaggle. As an MEng Computer Science graduate I have had exposure to a lot of different tech. Some of the projects on my website have been developed with Python, Java, C#, SQL, Javascript, Pascal/Delphi, and more - I consider Python to be my main language these days.</p>
			<p>My main passion now is data. Manipulating data, building models, and explaining insights to stakeholders - these are all things I enjoy doing day-to-day. I am always on the lookout for ways to further develop my data skills, especially if I can incorporate one of my other interests too.</p>
			<p>So as you may have guessed I'm not just into computers. In my spare time I enjoy running - my half marathon personal best is currently 1:32:23, and I've also completed the Berlin and London Marathons. I am also a keen lover of nature, having previously volunteered to work with animals such as elephants, monkeys, and birds. Finally, I am an avid Leicester City supporter who are without a doubt the greatest football team to grace the Earth.</p>
