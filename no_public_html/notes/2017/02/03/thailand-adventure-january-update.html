        		<p>It will be quite a short update this month. As previously mentioned, in November I signed up for a month of volunteering in Thailand in the summer, but I am required to raise a lot of money to make this happen. Over the past month I have done a few things to get myself up to the huge target that has been set for me. Near the start of the month I was bucketing on the streets of Leamington Spa to raise some money - and I managed to get &pound;50 in the hours I spent there. I always find street collections interesting as some people love to come up to you and talk about the fundraising that you are doing; other people will try to avoid you as much as possible while you are collecting money, and will avoid all eye contact if possible. There was also a Warwick street collection set up for me but I was unable to go due to illness.</p>

        		<p>My virtual car boot sale is almost over, which brought in approximately &pound;100, as well as allowing me to clear out some of my old junk. Moving on from that, I've managed to plan out a lot more things for February and March to help myself raise the money. Today I am actually going round campus aiming to sell cookies that my flatmates are helping to make - my aim for this is the raise at least &pound;50 but I know that I can get a lot more than that. I am also hoping to do an online raffle, I already have a few prizes to give away which I obtained for free so this could be a very profitable event. The car boot sale which I discussed in the previous update is likely to go ahead in March when I have some time off from university. There will also be two more street collections during that time, along with one which I have planned for February. Hopefully the next two months will be the big two in terms of raising money for this once-in-a-lifetime adventure.</p>
