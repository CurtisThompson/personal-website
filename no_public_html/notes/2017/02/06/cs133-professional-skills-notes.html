        		<p>The first module for which I have completed notes at university is CS133 Professional Skills - and these are the first university notes that I am uploading to my website. This whole module (taken by every first year Computer Scientist at the University of Warwick) covers several different issues related to the computing and IT profession such as different laws, rights and possibilities for employees. It is a very content heavy module, and I had a lot to learn for my January test (I passed by the way), and therefore you will find that these notes are larger than any other notes I have uploaded to this website in the past.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Law in the UK</li>
        			<li>The Computing Profession</li>
        			<li>Organisations</li>
        			<li>Finances and Accounting</li>
        			<li>Human Resource Issues</li>
        			<li>Anti-Discrimination Legislation</li>
        			<li>Intellectual Property Rights</li>
        			<li>Software Contracts and Licenses</li>
        			<li>Health and Safety</li>
        			<li>Data Protection</li>
        			<li>Privacy and Freedom of Information</li>
        			<li>Internet Issues</li>
        			<li>The Computer Misuse Act</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>It is not a very exciting module for anyone who came to university to learn about computer science, but as long as you are able to remember facts you will not struggle with this part of the module. CS133 also involves some more technical aspects such as shell scripting and the UNIX system, and some unique aspects for the course such as writing large essays (at least so it seems in my first year so far). I hope you find my notes useful, regardless of whether you are studying this module or not.</p>
