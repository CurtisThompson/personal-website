        		<p>Back in November I signed up to a volunteering trip of a lifetime! It involves spending three weeks in Thailand in the summer, working with a tribal community on projects such as building and decorating new buildings or teaching the children English, working with an elephant sanctuary to help abused and orphaned elephants, and a few days mixed in between to stop us getting over exhausted from the hard work. The main challenge with this is that I am aiming to raise &pound;2500 for the charity (FutureSense Foundation), which is hard work.</p>

        		<p>One of my first main events to raise this money was a trip to Coventry, bucketing on the streets. This whole adventure is with a team of around 25 other students at the University of Warwick, and most of us were out on the streets of Coventry that day to raise money. And guess what, I was dressed as an elephant! Since I'll be working with elephants I thought this would be a good idea, and it did attract some attention... A few kids came over to me (which is good, they seem more likely to want to give money than adults) and one girl came over to me to say that see liked my trunk! It was a really interesting day. I was planning to arrive earlier than I did but I overslept, and I was planning to stay longer but my hands froze. Next time I will be setting more alarms, and bringing gloves so that I can raise more money.</p>
        		<p>I've been doing some other small events; a chilli-eating challenge, working with a company for a few days and a virtual car boot sale. My virtual car boot sale is still ongoing, and I'll be back on the streets in January to raise even more money. Leamington Spa is my next spot, I am hoping to stay out for at least 5 hours to get as much money as I can. I'm looking at what else I can do too to raise the money, an actual car boot sale may be needed for the small things which I can't shift online. But with almost &pound;400 raised so far I am very happy with my progress.</p>
        		<p>So let's see what I can do in January, and if you haven't already, please consider donating. I'm so excited!</p>
