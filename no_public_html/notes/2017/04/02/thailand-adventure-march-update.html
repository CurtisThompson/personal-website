        		<p>I'm over halfway to reaching my overall fundraising goal, and the project in Thailand is getting even closer!</p>
        		<p>On the first weekend of March I took part in Warwick LOST 2017 to raise some money for the project. The LOST event involved getting blindfolded, kidnapped and taken to an unknown area of the UK. We then had to make it back to university without spending any money! I took part in this challenge with my friend, and we had absolutely no plan going into it - we didn't realise it would be so hard. Led off the coach, we took our blindfolds off to find ourselves under the Angel of the North! Long story short, we eventually made it back to university and raised almost 100 pounds in the process. It was tough, but worth it!</p>

        		<p>Along with the LOST challenge, I also helped to run a movie night to raise some more money. I was mainly the technical guy (as Computer Science == IT) so had to handle setting up the room, and the movie - and closing everything down when the movie was finished, something which is slightly harder when you haven't since the film before. I did not raise as much money from the movie night (as it was split between all five of us who helped to run it) but I enjoyed it just as much.</p>
        		<p>Next month I aim to make it over the 2000 pound mark, and then it won't be a big struggle to reach my final target before the Thailand adventure!</p>
