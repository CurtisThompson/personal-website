        		<p>These are my notes for the CS130 Mathematics for Computing Scientists I module at my university. There are actually two different mathematics modules that all first year computer scientists must take. This is the first one which deals with discrete mathematics, while the module that I studied in the second term dealt with continuous mathematics. I have posted some shorter notes on my website earlier this month however these notes will cover each topic in more detail. In my opinion, the best way to get good at maths is by practicing questions, but I've made sure my notes cover everything that I need to know to be able to answer any question in my exams.</p>

        		<ul>
        			<li>Boolean Operators</li>
        			<li>Laws of Logic</li>
        			<li>Sets</li>
        			<li>Relations</li>
        			<li>Functions</li>
        			<li>Induction</li>
        			<li>Graphs</li>
        			<li>Probability</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I will be sitting my exam for this module in just over a week, but these notes are here to stay forever! So make sure you use them well! I better be getting back to revision now...</p>
