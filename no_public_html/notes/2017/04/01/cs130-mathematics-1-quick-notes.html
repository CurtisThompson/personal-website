        		<p>With two of my seven first year exams approaching at the end of the month I've been busy writing up some notes for those modules. One interesting thing for my maths exam is the ability to take in a crib sheet with notes on it. I have been thinking about my crib sheet recently, and I believe that if I can neatly fit the whole syllabus on two pieces of paper I might be able to fill a small crib sheet. This is what I have uploaded today - the quick notes on the whole syllabus. These were intended just for me, but since I upload all of my notes onto this site (and I'm going to be abroad for a week so can't access paper notes) I figured why not upload these too?</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Logic</li>
        			<li>Sets</li>
        			<li>Relations</li>
        			<li>Functions</li>
        			<li>Induction</li>
        			<li>Graphs</li>
        			<li>Probability</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I really struggled to understand some of the concepts, and apply them, while we were going through them in lectures. I had to spend several hours on my own to get my head around parts, and even as I make these notes I find that I don't understand everything. If you use these notes then you will probably need your own books too, but you might find them useful as a quick reference. I hope you find my notes useful!</p>
