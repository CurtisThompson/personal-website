        		<p>These are my notes for the CS118 Programming for Computing Scientists module at my university. This is a first year module which specifically covers the language Java. I have never had any formal teaching for this language (I have, however, for Pascal) and people taking this module are not expected to have even programmed before. Therefore you will find the topics covered in these notes cover all of the basics of the Java programming language. If you have programmed in a different language before then you may not find these notes very useful, however they do contain examples of syntax for different statements - so anyone may find something of use in these notes.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Data Representation</li>
        			<li>Primitive Data Types</li>
        			<li>Java Operators</li>
        			<li>Conditional Statements</li>
        			<li>Iterative Statements</li>
        			<li>Arrays</li>
        			<li>Methods and Scope</li>
        			<li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
        			<li>Inheritance</li>
        			<li>Abstract Classes and Interfaces</li>
        			<li>Errors and Exceptions</li>
        			<li>Generics</li>
        			<li>SOLID Design Principles</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I will be sitting the exam for this module in a few weeks, I believe it is the first exam I sit this summer. I personally find that this module is not too difficult (especially in comparison to some of the other modules as I have previous experience of programming, and I won't need to revise it as much as modules like maths. On that note, my mathematics notes will be uploaded shortly! Enjoy these notes!</p>
