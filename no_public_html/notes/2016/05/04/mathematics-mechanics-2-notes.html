    	<meta name="description" content="Mechanics 2, the module which appears to have the most real life applications. It deals with the movement of particles, how they react when hanging or colliding, and energy. I have uploaded more hand-written notes which can be downloaded from this page. The notes for this module seem to be a lot smaller than many of the other modules. With core modules you have to use different techniques in a similar way each time however with mechanics you are given less techniques and information, but they are often applied in more unique ways which is why the notes are smaller. The best way to get good at this module is practice." />

        		<p>Mechanics 2, the module which appears to have the most real life applications. It deals with the movement of particles, how they react when hanging or colliding, and energy. I have uploaded more hand-written notes which can be downloaded from this page. The notes for this module seem to be a lot smaller than many of the other modules. With core modules you have to use different techniques in a similar way each time however with mechanics you are given less techniques and information, but they are often applied in more unique ways which is why the notes are smaller.

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Kinematics of Particles</li>
        			<li>Centres of Mass</li>
        			<li>Work, Energy and Power</li>
        			<li>Collisions</li>
        			<li>Statics of Rigid Bodies</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>Hopefully you find the notes useful. The information in the course can be covered in a day but you should spend a lot more time solving problems to get good at it, if you have any questions for me then leave them in the comments. Also, this course relies on knowledge from Mechanics 1 (such as 'suvat' equations and moments) so be sure to check that out before attempting Mechanics 2. Enjoy!</p>
