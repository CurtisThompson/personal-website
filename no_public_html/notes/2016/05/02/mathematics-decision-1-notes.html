        		<p>Decision maths time, I've now uploaded notes for a majority of my further maths modules. This module is very strange as it does not feel like the typical maths you learned at school, but it links in a lot with computer science so I find it very interesting. This module mostly deals with algorithms (sets of instructions), and using them to solve various problems such as sorting a list or moving from A to B as quickly as possible. Maybe it won't appeal to those who like pure mathematics, but some who don't find that interesting may enjoy decision maths.</p>

        			<li>Bubble Sort</li>
        			<li>Quick Sort</li>
        			<li>Binary Search</li>
        			<li>Bin-Packing Algorithms</li>
        			<li>Graphs and Networks</li>
        			<li>Matrices</li>
        			<li>Algorithm Flow Charts</li>
        			<li>Kruskal's Algorithm</li>
        			<li>Prim's Algorithm</li>
        			<li>Dijkstra's Algorithm</li>

        		</ul>
        		<p>The list may look long (possibly?) but it is actually a very short module. If you are looking for further information of these topics please comment below, or check out my computing notes as they also contain information on searching, sorting and graphs - decision maths and computing link closely as I previously mentioned. Now enjoy your revision!</p>
