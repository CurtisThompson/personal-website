        		<p>Astrophysics is the one area of physics which seems to get everyone excited no matter how much or how little they know about it. That's exactly why I chose this physics module to study - that and there are no options that particularly linked well to Computer Science. These hand-written notes are for the AQA specification of A2 Physics, specifically for the optional Astrophysics module. I have put many hours into making these notes for myself, but since I am told my notes are good I have made them available for you to download.</p>

        		<p>I hope you find the notes useful. As of writing I have four more modules left to upload notes for; C4 and FP3 Mathematics, PHYA4 and PHYA5 Physics. Hopefully I will be able to upload these soon, but for now, enjoy these notes!</p>
