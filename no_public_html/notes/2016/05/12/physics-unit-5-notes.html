        		<p>These notes cover the compulsory topics of the AQA Physics A Unit 5 specification, and follow on from my previous Astrophysics notes which were for the optional section of unit 5. My handwritten notes on this page cover nuclear physics and thermal physics, two interesting topics. The note are now available to download.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Rutherford Scattering</li>
        			<li>Alpha, Beta, Gamma Radiation</li>
        			<li>Radioactive Decay</li>
        			<li>Uses of Radiation</li>
        			<li>N-Z Graph</li>
        			<li>Nuclear Energy</li>
        			<li>Nuclear Fission</li>
        			<li>Nuclear Fusion</li>
        			<li>Ideal Gases</li>
        			<li>Kinetic Theory of Gases</li>
        			<li>Thermal Physics</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I hope you find the notes useful. There are now only three modules left to upload notes for, two for mathematics and one for physics. They should be up soon as I have my first exam next week!</p>
