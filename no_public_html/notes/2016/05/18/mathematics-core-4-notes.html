        		<p>On this page you can download my notes for the Edexcel Mathematics Core 4 module. All of my notes are handwritten by me, and were made just for me so you may find some parts have too much detail for you, or not enough. However I chose to upload them as I'm often told how good my notes are, so thought I may as well make them available to everyone - there's no harm in that! This module covers partial fractions, vectors and binomial expansion as well as extra coordinate geometry, differentiation and integration following on from previous modules.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Partial Fractions</li>
        			<li>Coordinate Geometry</li>
        			<li>Binomial Expansion</li>
        			<li>Differentiation</li>
        			<li>Vectors</li>
        			<li>Integration</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I hope you find the notes useful. This is one of the two modules which I am resitting so you might find the information in this file is less than some of the other notes I have made. However, if you have learnt the module then the notes should be helpful and you should be alright.</p>
