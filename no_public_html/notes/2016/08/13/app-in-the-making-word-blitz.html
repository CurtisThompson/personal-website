        		<p>Over the past few days, when I've not been watching shows at the Fringe Festival, I've been dusting off my C# hat and working on a new app which will become my first published app on the Google Play Store. The name is 'Word Blitz' and in this article I will just share a few things about it for my eager readers.</p>

        		<p>The idea for this game came to me while watching Countdown, thinking about how I could practice to improve my own scores. Word Blitz is a game where you receive a selection of letters and have to make words as fast as possible. Each time you submit a word you get a new selection of letters to make another word. Each word gives you a certain amount of points, longer words and words made quicker will award more points. The purpose of the game is to make words as fast as possible to earn a high score - great practice for Countdown.</p>
        		
        		<p>At the moment I am currently working on implementing the Google API into my game which should allow players to earn achievements and post their scores to the leaderboards. It is not a difficult task, but since I have never published a game to the Play Store I am taking my time to learn exactly what I am doing. This part of the game should be done by tomorrow, and the main things left to do will be to fix a few bugs still in the game and some graphics required for when I publish it to the Play Store.</p>
        		
        		<p>The game is almost done. One part I am still questioning whether to change is the time limit. The player starts with 60 seconds and can earn more time by making long words. With the current algorithm I use to award extra time I've managed to make a game go on for at least five minutes (it took many attempts though). I would like five minutes to be considered a very long game so I may have to tweak the algorithm to make sure that it is a hard task for the average player. The algorithm does stop the game going on for more than ten minutes for even the best of players so I have to be careful to keep that working - the best players will then be looking for long words too to get a high score.</p>
        		
        		<p>If you are interested in playing the game (of course you are) then I will be posting another update next week where I will hopefully have a definite release date for my game. As I say, the game is almost complete, not long to wait now.</p>
