        		<p><strong>Nine Letter Practice Mode</strong><br />A new mode to practice finding nine letter words, the most valuable words in the game. A combination of letters is given which is guaranteed to have a nine letter word in, the user must just try to find it. One point is awarded for each nine letter word found. The user has the ability to skip a selection of letters if they find it too hard, as this is just a practice mode.</p>
