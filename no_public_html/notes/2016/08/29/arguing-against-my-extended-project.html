        		<p>The conclusion they reached was that intelligence "measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments"</p>
        		
        		<p>As mentioned in the paper, whether a machine can be considered intelligent hinges on the whole definition of intelligence that is used. After setting out some criteria the definition above is given and used throughout the rest of the paper. This definition is, in fact, not a satisfactory definition to use alone when determining the intelligence of anything. The definition does match the criteria stated but it does not give enough of a challenge to determine intelligence. A very simplified example would be whether an individual could walk in a straight line from A to B - for humans and many other species a very simple task. Now imagine completing several other simple goals. An individual which could complete those goals has been defined as intelligent based on the above definition, but it has not been challenged and has completed tasks that any other individual may be able to complete. The goal should have some level of difficulty and not be achievable by all members of a community. The whole use of the definition of intelligence could put the rest of the paper into question.</p>

        		<p>This is used to argue that Eugene Goostman, a chatterbot, cannot be considered intelligent. The problem with this statement is that with our current scientific knowledge we cannot confirm whether or not humans work in a similar way, just using different (and possibly more complex) filtering algorithms. If humans do use filtering algorithms in a similar way then this statement would suggest humans cannot be intelligent. However, regardless of whether or not humans work by this method, determining whether this is an intelligent way of achieving a goal should surely depend on what algorithms are use. Filtering out sentences based on keywords and then selecting a random sentence may not be intelligent as it might not achieve the desired effect or goal each time, but more advanced filtering and selecting algorithms may allow the goal to be achieved every time, or at least at a comparable rate to humans.</p>
