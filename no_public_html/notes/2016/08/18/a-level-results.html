        			<strong>A-Level Edexcel Mathematics</strong><br />
        			Grade: A* <br />
        			Marks: 87% <br />
        			Completed the whole of this course in my first year instead of over two years (like most people who want to do the Further Maths course). Introduces differential calculus, vectors, some coordinate geometry and algebra techniques plus areas of mechanics and statistics which I chose to do for this course. Even though the grade remains the same, the marks change as units can be swapped between Mathematics and Further Mathematics.

        			<strong>A-Level Edexcel Further Mathematics</strong><br />
        			Grade: A<br />
        			Marks: 82%<br />
        			This course expands upon the Mathematics course, and looks at some things that we would need to look at during a university course. Some of the more complex and interesting topics were matrices, vectors and some of the decision maths (which links closely to computer science). The course isn't much more difficult than the Mathematics course, it just looks at several topics that you might not have previously seen.

        		<strong>A-Level AQA Computing</strong><br />
        		Grade: A<br />
        		Marks: 89%<br />
        		My favourite course! The first year was solely based around exams, one programming exam in Pascal and one written exam. The second year was more exciting with a year long programming project which we got to choose (there was a separate exam too, but this is more exciting). I chose to do an A-Level Maths Revision tool, which you can find below along with the rest of my notes for the project and my second year.

        		<strong>A-Level AQA Physics A</strong><br />
        		Grade: B<br />
        		Marks: 74%<br />
        		Honestly, I did not find this course as exciting as the other courses I took. Partly because Computing was always going to be my favourite, but partly because this course feels a lot harder than the others which put me off at times. Speaking to many other people who took the course it does seem one of the harder A-Levels. But there are many interesting parts to the course such as Astrophysics (my optional unit) and the sub-atomic particles.

        		<strong>AS-Level WJEC Electronics</strong><br />
        		Grade: A<br />
        		Marks: 96%<br />
        		Dropped after my first year of the course so I could continue with mathematics, computing and physics. Enjoyed the course however, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has any sort of interest in electronics, computers, engineering or technology.

        		<strong>AQA Extended Project Qualifications</strong><br />
        		Grade: A*<br />
        		Marks: 96%<br />
        		To what extent can the processes of artificial intelligence be considered actual intelligence? That was the question I spent six months working on for my extended project. I have linked to my final result plus some extra notes on the topic below.

        			<strong>Notes and Resources</strong><br />
        			Below are a collection of notes and resources related to my A-Levels which you can find on this website. All of the notes are notes that I used to pass my A-Levels, while you can also find coursework (such as for Computing and the EPQ) and discussions related to my A-Levels.
