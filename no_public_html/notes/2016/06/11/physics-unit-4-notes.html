        		<p>Physics Unit 4 is the compulsory module that everyone must take in their second year, and it looks at the topics of motion and fields. On this page you are able to download my handwritten notes for this topic to use for your revision. I have tried to order the notes in specification order the best I can, and they should include most of the information you will need.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Momentum</li>
        			<li>Circular Motion</li>
        			<li>Gravitational Fields</li>
        			<li>Simple Harmonic Motion</li>
        			<li>Electric Fields</li>
        			<li>Capacitors</li>
        			<li>Magnetic Fields</li>
        			<li>Electromagnetic Induction</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I hope you find the notes useful. I have been distracted by exams which is why it took me a while to upload the notes - but you will find my physics notes are now complete. The final odule for me to upload is Further Pure Mathematics 3, and I will try to upload them at some point in between my final 9 exams. If you have any questions, just ask below.</p>
