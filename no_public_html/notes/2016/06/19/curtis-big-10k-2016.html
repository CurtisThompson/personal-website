        		<p>On July 17th 2016 I will be running as part of the Leicester Big 10k to raise money for the Duke of Edinburgh charity. I have two aims for this run. The first aim is to break my 10k PB time of 42:22. My other aim is to raise &pound;100 for charity. As I write this I have currently raised &pound;44, so there is approximately a month left to keep training and raise the final &pound;56 I am aiming to get. If you can I would appreciate you donating to the cause, which I explain below. Every little helps, and it all goes to charity!</p>

        		<p>Three years ago I completed my Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award, which involves volunteering for six months, learning to cook, camp and keep fit for three months and going on two multi-day walks around the countryside (camping included). After walking through fields with bulls, seeing a friend's tent collapse while camping in snow, and getting 3 hours sleep a night I decided to not continue onto the Silver Award. You'd never guess why... Now this year they are offering a special Diamond Award, and to earn it I get to do my favourite hobby while raising money for young people who really need it!</p>
        		<p>DofE is a charity that has existed for over 70 years and has inspired and transformed the lives of millions of young people from all walks of life. From volunteering to physical activities, life skills to expeditions, achieving a DofE Award is a passport to a brighter future, valued by employers and universities. It is the world's leading youth achievement award, and has support many disadvantaged young people across the UK and the world. It is aiming to give 2 million more people from the UK it's life-changing opportunities by 2020, and money raised from this run will go directly towards that.</p>
        		<p>Please consider donating, it will help so much! And thanks to all the support from everyone I've spoken to (or those who have donated) so far.</p>
