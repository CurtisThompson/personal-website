These two pages of notes are all I needed to get 100% of the marks in the harder of the two electronics exams I sat in the first year, and are all anyone will need as long as they sit the same WJEC specification as me - I will explain more below. They are now available!" />

        		<p>As I mentioned yesterday, I found a bunch of notes while looking through old paperwork from yesterday. In it, I found two pages of notes - possibly the two most important pages of notes that anyone could ever need. These two pages of notes are all I needed to get 100% of the marks in the harder of the two electronics exams I sat in the first year, and are all anyone will need as long as they sit the same WJEC specification as me - I will explain more below. They are now available!</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Capacitors</li>
        			<li>Diodes</li>
        			<li>Schmitt Inverters</li>
        			<li>Load Voltages</li>
        			<li>MOSFETs</li>
        			<li>555s</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>Once you realise that the same questions appear each year, you can probably cover this whole unit in a few days and score 100% without understanding anything. Literally, the same 8-10 questions appear each year (sometimes broken down into different questions, but asking the exact same thing) but with different numbers for the calculations. That is exactly what these notes look at. The questions are drawn in black while a short description of how to get through the questions along with tips are given in red. After you look at these notes, check a few past papers and see how similar they are.</p>
        		<p>I think this unit in particular shows how bad the education system in the UK can be at times, as long as you can remember a few things you don't need any understanding of what is going on. However there are some very interesting things in the unit if you want to learn about them. If you are looking for an easy grade to obtain while doing A-Levels I would recommend this course. That is all I will say. Enjoy the notes!</p>
