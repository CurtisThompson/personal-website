        		<p>Further Pure 3 is the final, and hardest, compulsory module in the Further Mathematics A-Level. It builds on what is done in the previous two further pure modules so you should look at those before this module. I have uploaded my handwritten notes here for everyone to use for learning and revision, and they cover all of the topics in the module. All of the topics are extensions on what has been done in the previous modules except for hyperbolic functions (however they link closely with trigonometric functions from core 3) so the difficulty is not learning new topics but building on what should already be known.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Hyperbolic Functions</li>
        			<li>Ellipses</li>
        			<li>Hyperbola</li>
        			<li>Further Differentiation</li>
        			<li>Further Integration</li>
        			<li>Vectors</li>
        			<li>Matrices</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I hope you find the notes useful. These are the last notes that I had to upload, so it is all finally complete! You can now find all of my notes for this year on my website. I now have 9 exams to complete (done a few already) so I must get back to focusing on those, and of course I'll be using my notes for it. If you have any questions on this module just ask in the comments section below.</p>
