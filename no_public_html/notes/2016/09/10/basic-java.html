		        <p><strong>Output</strong><br /><br />The first thing you are likely to learn when programming is how to write the "Hello World" program. This is simply a program which displays a message on the screen. In Java, only one line is needed which is shown below.</p>
		
		        <div class="notes-blockquote">
			        System.out.println("Hello World");
		        </div>
		
		        <p>Outputting data is required in many programs so this statement will be used a lot if you decide to learn Java.</p>
		        <p><strong>Declaring Variables</strong><br /><br />Variables are a fundamental part of most programming languages, they are used to store values under a specific name. A variable must be declared before it can be used by stating its type (such as an integer) and its identifier (or name). Once that has been done, a value can be stored in the variable and the value can be retrieved using the identifier.</p>
				<div class="notes-blockquote">
		        	int MyAge;<br />
			        MyAge = 18;
		        </div>
				<p>The most common data types are int (integers, whole numbers), float (decimal numbers), char (single characters), String (collections of characters or words) and bool (true or false). There are also less common data types used in specific situations.</p>
		        <p><strong>IF-ELSE Statement</strong><br /><br />The if-else statement is used to control the flow of the program, or to execute different statements depending on different conditions. If-else statements can be as long, short, complex or simple as you like.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			if (8 > 4) {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Java is amazing!");<br />
        			} else if (8 == 4) {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Is my maths correct?");<br />
        			} else {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Try again...");<br />
        			}
        		</div>
		        <p>The if-else statement requires the "if" section of the code. The "else if" and "else" sections are both optional, and only need a preceding "if" section to be used. Also, an infinite number of "else if" sections can follow the "if" section, but there can only be one "else" section.</p>
            	<p><strong>Ternary Statement</strong><br /><br />The ternary statement will often allow an if-else statement to be written in a single line. It is composed of three parts; a boolean expression, a single statement if the expression is true, and a single statement if the expression is false. The second line of the code below shows a ternary statement.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			int FuelLevel = 3;<br />
        			char CanDrive = (fuelLevel > 0) ? 'Y' : 'N';
        		</div>
		        <p>If-else statements cannot always be changed into ternary statements. Experiment with them to see exactly what they can do.</p>
		        <p><strong>Switch Statement</strong><br /><br />The switch statement allows different statements to be executed depending on the value of a variable. It is comprised of several different "cases", with each case representing one or more possible values for the variable.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			switch (Rating) {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 1: System.out.println("A terrible film");<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case 5: System.out.println("An amazing film");<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break;<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;default: System.out.println("An average film");<br />
        			}
        		</div>
		        <p>The default case is also often used in case that the variable does not match any of the cases in the code. The break statement is used to tell the program that it does not need to check the remaining cases, and is therefore not needed on the last case.</p>
				<p><strong>For Loop</strong><br /><br />The for loop executes a sequence of statements multiple times. A variable is incremented (or decremented), with the sequence of statements being executed each time, until a certain condition regarding that variable is met. This is shown in the code below.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			for (int Counter = 0; Counter <= 5; Counter++) {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("The counter is on: " + Counter);<br />
        			}
        		</div>
        		<p>The three main parts at the start of the for loop are the initialisation (declaring the loop variable), the boolean expression (which determines whether the loop is executed again), and the update (to change the loop variable). New programming can sometimes forget this, but you will get used to it eventually.</p>
        		<p><strong>While Loop</strong><br /><br />The while loop will repeat a sequence of statements while a condition is true. The condition is checked before the statements are executed, and then each time after all of the statements have been executed.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			while (IsWorldWarThree) {<br />
        			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AttackCountry();<br/ >
        			}
        		</div>
        		<p>There is also a do-while loop which does not check the condition before executing the sequence of statements the first time. Which loop you choose to use depends on whether you want the statements to be executed at least once.</p>
        		<p><strong>Comments</strong><br /><br />Some programmers will tell you that comments are the most important part of the program. Comments are simply parts of the program that are not going to be executed by the program. They often contain descriptions of sections of the code or important information about the code.</p>
        		<div class="notes-blockquote">
        			// A single line comment<br />
        			/*<br />
        			And<br />
        			A<br />
        			Multi-Line<br />
        			Comment<br />
        			*/
        		</div>
        		<p>Comments can only be read by people who can see the source code. They are important in a code so that other programmers can understand your code, or so that you can remember what a section of code does if you haven't seen it in a while. Get into the habit of using them.</p>
