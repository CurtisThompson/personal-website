        		<p>After uploading my computing notes, and being told they were very good, I have decided to upload my notes for my statistics exam too. These were all written up by hand several weeks ago and it was the first topic I managed to completely finish notes on - which is also why I think it is one of the easier topics. On this page you will be able to view and download all of my notes in a pdf file. They are based on the A-Level Edexcel Mathematics specification, but may be helpful for anyone studying a statistics course.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in the notes are:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Binomial Distribution</li>
        			<li>Poisson Distribution</li>
        			<li>Continuous Random Variables</li>
        			<li>Continuous Uniform Distribution</li>
        			<li>Approximations</li>
        			<li>Sampling and Statistics</li>
        			<li>Definitions</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>The only thing missing from these notes for my specification is hypothesis testing, which I did not make notes on. Providing you have seen a question on hypothesis testing before you should be able to handle all of the possible questions on it as long as you know the other content such as binomial distribution, poisson distribution and approximations. Normal distribution is also not covered in the notes as it is expected to be known from previous courses. Lets hope our statistics exams now go well!</p>
