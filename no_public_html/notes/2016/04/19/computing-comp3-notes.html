        		<p>Recently I have been writing up all of my notes for my computing exam in the summer. After hours of writing them up by hand someone questioned why I didn't just do them online as a could easily lose a paper copy of my notes (they are not suggesting I lose things easily, I hope). From that conversation I decided to scan all of my notes onto my computer, and from there post them onto my website. On this page you will be able to view and download all of my notes in a pdf file. It is based on the current A-Level AQA Computing specification but for any computing or computer science course these notes may come in handy, so please view them.</p>

        		<p>I may in the future upload similar notes for my maths exams but for now you will have to enjoy these notes. As far as I know all the information in them is correct as based on the specification and exams I will be sitting, so if you sit a different exam or course you may find some of the information in the notes may not be acceptable answers - partially because exams are stupid, go and learn whatever you want! For example, the definition of algorithm I'm expected to use in decision maths would not be accepted in this course, and the definition in these notes may not be accepted on other courses. Anyway, please read through the notes and use them to contribute to your own notes, they are available to view and download below.</p>
