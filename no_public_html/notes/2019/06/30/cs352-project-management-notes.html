        		<p>These are my notes for the CS352 Project Management for Computer Science module at my university. Having now received my results for the third year of university I am proud to say that I achieved 79% in this module. Some of the content (particularly related to agile methodologies) is repeated from a previous module last year, but a majority of the content is new.</p>

        		<ul>
        			<li>Project Initiation</li>

        			<li>PRINCE2</li>
        			<li>Budgeting</li>
        			<li>Forecasting</li>

        			<li>Agile Methodologies</li>
        			<li>Leadership and Teamwork</li>
        			<li>Risk</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>It is important to consider what I think is useful from the module, and what I may use in the future. In the module we learnt about several lean and agile methodologies. In a previous module we did cover scrum and sprints, but this time we looked at further ideas such as a kanban board. When organising a multi-skilled team in an office, a kanban board may be very useful to consider using so that we can pull work along the system and make sure everything is correctly developed and tested. I know one of my friends used a kanban board in one of her previous internships, so this may be useful to remember.</p>
        		<p>The early seminars in this module helped reinforce the ideas of budgeting and forecasting through small exercises, and the later seminars helped us practice all of the skills from the module through a group task. We had to fictionally take on a project from a selection of projects, and then plan, budget, and analyse the project to ensure it would be successful. At the end of the task we had to have a meeting with stakeholders to convince them that we were able to make this projet a success. In other modules we often focus on how good the technology or implementation is, so it is interesting to look at it from the perspective of different stakeholders (as you probably will have to do in real life). I'm sure this module will be very useful to me when I enter industry full-time.</p>
