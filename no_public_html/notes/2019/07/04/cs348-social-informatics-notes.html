        		<p>These are my notes for the CS348 Social Informatics module at my university. Most people who took this module did so as it looked easy in comparison to the hard modules like Machine Learning and Neural Computing, but that's not the reason I'm happy I took this module. Studying the usability of software and the emergence of disruptive technologies will become very useful in future jobs - in fact, this module actually helped me get my summer job! At the end of the yer I achieved 70% in this module.</p>

        			<li>Socio-Technical Systems</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>When I mention this module to people, I usually talk about the coursework. Not only was it interesting to complete, I also managed to get my summer job by talking about my experiences of this coursework in the interview. Basically, the coursework involved reviewing an old website (that is used for selling fruit and vegetables online) and create a report that details its usability problems. Once we had done that, we had to redesign the website to remove as many of the problems as we could. Finally, we had to use some of the techniques taught in the module to compare the old website to the new one that we had created. I have been saying "we" a lot as I was in a team of five people for this coursework (and I was the team leader).</p>
        		<p>The number of usability problems we found in the website we unbelieveable - even when you consider that the website was specifically built for this coursework to have lots of usability problems. We had colour issues (the landing page had red text on a bright green background), consistency issues (images of many different sizes for the items on the product page), and some cases where parts of the website were not even working. Think of something that could be wrong with a basic website, and you can probably find it on this website. Fortunately it made the redesign of the website even more fun.</p>
        		<p>So people will say this was an easy module to score highly in (which I would agree with), but I believe it is also a module with a good piece of coursework that you can learn a lot from.</p>
