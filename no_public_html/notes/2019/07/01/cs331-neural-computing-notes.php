        		<p>These are my notes for the CS331 Neural Computing module at my university, a module that looks at both biological and artificial neural networks. Although some people questioned why we were looking at animal psychology and brains at times, it is very important to understand the workings of the biological neural networks so that you can understand how artificial ones work. This is the only module this year where I did not make any detailed notes due to my revision style for this module, but it paid off as I achieved 78% at the end of the year.</p>
        		<p>The topics covered in this module include:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>History of Neuroscience and Artificial Neural Networks</li>
        			<li>Related Philosophy</li>
        			<li>Biological Neurons</li>
        			<li>Artificial Neurons</li>
        			<li>Biological Neural Networks</li>
        			<li>Artificial Neural Networks</li>
        			<li>Coding</li>
        			<li>Memory and Learning</li>
        			<li>Mammilian and Machine Case Studies</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>Most people look at this module at the start of the third year and think it is an interesting course. Some people, however, can't the the relevance to their degree so don't choose to take the module. Others also can't see the relevance but pick it out of curiosity. Then there is a third group who understand the importance and relevance, and pick the module. I think I fell somewhere between the second and third group at the start of the year. Coming out of the module, I still think I am somewhere between those two groups. When we cover certain topics such as habituation and sensitisation it can be very hard to see the link back to Computer Science, but then it is much easier to see the importance of understanding axons and dendrites when viewing artificial neurons. This is the strange thing about the module; you wll definitely come out with a better understanding of artificial neural networks, but at the same time you will also understand come psychological concepts (definitely worth understanding for life in general, but not related to our degree).</p>
        		<p>This is clearly if you read the book recommended by the professor running the module: The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat by Oliver Sacks. Before I give a little more detail, I want to say this book is worth reading and you should buy a copy straight away. The book looks at several cases that Dr. Sacks has dealt with in his time as a doctor, all relating to some aspect of brain function. I will not spoil the book, but the titular story is based upon a man who is unable to recognise whole objects, and instead relies on viewing individual details. He, obviously, mistakes his wife for a hat during that story due to his condition. There are several more interesting stories including The Lost Mariner and The Twins. Why was this book recommended to us? After reading it, I can see almost no link to our course. But it was a good recommendation nevertheless, and I hope you read it too.</p>
