        		<p>These are my notes for the CS346 Advanced Databases module at my university. On completion of this module I scored 83%, so it is fair to say it is one of my strongest modules during the first three years of my degree. However I did not always think of it like that, as some of the concepts in this module took me a while to understand, but when I did understand the content I was able to perform as well as I did.</p>

        		<p>The topics covered in these notes include:</p>
        		<ul>
        			<li>Data Storage</li>
        			<li>Physical Data Organisation</li>
        			<li>Data Indexing</li>
        			<li>Database Design and Tuning</li>
        			<li>Query Processing</li>
        			<li>Query Optimisation</li>
        			<li>Big Data</li>
        			<li>Data Warehousing</li>
        			<li>Transactions and Concurrency</li>
        			<li>Privacy and Security</li>
        		</ul>
        		<p>I orginally began to prepare for the module by looking deeper into SQL, but starting this module made me realise there is a lot more involved in databases than just writing some SQL queries. As well as all of the physical considerations, there are different ways to modify the software to increase the performance of the database (whether that is the speed of queries, the amount of data being stored, or any number of other factors). We also looked at technologies such as Hadoop and MapReduce in the coursework which help with the processing of big data.</p>
