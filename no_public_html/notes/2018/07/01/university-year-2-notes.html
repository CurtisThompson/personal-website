        		<p>It's over! I've finished my second year of university, and it sure was challenging. I made it through the year though, and managed to score an overall 73% to add onto my first year score of 81%. This year I've decided to upload some of my notes online. Although they may not be so useful it does mean that I can put the paper notes into the recycling bin as they will always be here now when I want to look at them. The notes for each module are contained in the section for that module, along with a description of what I had to do in the module.</p>
        		
        		<p><strong>Operating Systems and Computer Networks (CS241)</strong> was one of my five modules from term one, but definitely the most content heavy. It could be split into two modules really; Operating Systems looks at some of the main components behind modern operating systems such as processing and file systems, while computer networks focuses on the OSI and TCP/IP models, looking in-depth at what goes on at every layer.</p>

        		<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (CS255)</strong> was an optional module, but most people chose it anyway. Probably one of my favourite modules, it looks at different ways of developing AI agents through search problems, planning problems, probability and learning. The coursework, developing a robot to win in Robocode, was also my favourite piece of coursework I had done at university so far.</p>

        		<p><strong>Functional Programming (CS256)</strong> is something I did not know much about when I started this year. While this module mainly teaches how to program in Haskell, it also goes over features of functional programming languages in general so that we could theoretically pick up any functional language and learn it quickly.</p>

        		<p><strong>Database Systems (CS258)</strong> is a module that many people did not really like. This module covers the theory behind databases - relational algebra, normalisation and more. I think I actually enjoyed this module more than most people did. I will be considering the advanced database module next year now.</p>

        		<p><strong>Formal Languages (CS259)</strong> is one of three modules that I had to do in term two. I had a basic understanding of state autonoma from A-Levels, and most people who have programmed before will have come across regular expressions. This module does touch on those topics but goes a lot further into the world of formal languages by also looking at grammars, parsing and context-free languages.</p>

        		<p><strong>Algorithms (CS260)</strong>. Without a doubt a useful module for computer scientists. Also a long and hard module for anyone who doesn't instantly fall in love with it. This module really does what it says on the tin it looks at common algorithms and analyses them.</p>

        		<p><strong>Software Engineering (CS261)</strong> was one of my favourite modules (I get the feeling I have said this a few times now). It is not a huge module in terms of content, covering different software process models from start to finish, but half of the module relies on the coursework which was to develop a virtual trading assistant (in teams) for Deustche Bank. That may sound hard, but it was incredibly fun, and working with a new team of people was a great experience for me.</p>

        		<p><strong>Logic and Verification (CS262)</strong>, as taught by my own personal tutor. This is the area of mathematics that I prefer, over the algoritms side. We used different formal systems of logic to prove different facts, as well as covering program verification and the use of Alloy.</p>
