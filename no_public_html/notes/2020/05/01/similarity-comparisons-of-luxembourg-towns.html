				<h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Luxembourg is a small European country location between France, Belgium, and Germany. Why did it pique my interest? Because it is so small! With an area of 2,586 kilometres squared it is the seventh smallest country in Europe. It also has a population of less than a million (actually only approximately twice as many people live in Luxembourg than the city I currently live in), making it the eighth least populous country in Europe.</p>
                <p>Ask many people and there is only one place to go in Luxembourg: the capital city, Luxembourg City. But in fact, there are twelve towns in Luxembourg; Diekirch, Differdange, Dudelange, Echternach, Esch-sur-Alzette, Ettelbruck, Grevenmacher, Luxembourg City, Remich, Rumelange, Vianden, and Wiltz.</p>
                <p>My problem for this project was to create a recommender system to compare similar towns in Luxembourg. This could potentially be extended to find the most similar town in Luxembourg to any town or city in the world (perhaps if you are thinking of moving there), but for this project I focused just on the towns of Luxembourg.</p>

                <h2>Data</h2>
                <p>To make comparisons between towns I focused on using just two data sources.</p>
                <p>The first data source was Wikipedia. The great thing about Wikipedia is that data is so easy to scrape using a Python package like BeautifulSoup, and all of the information is free to use. I used Wikipedia to gain statistics information on each town such as area, population, and the canton they belong to.</p>
                <p>I also used the Foursquare API to gain data on venues within each town. Foursquare provides data on restaurants, parks, hotels, government buildings, and other similar establishments in the towns.</p>

                <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
                <p>I needed to conduct analysis to find out what features would be useful in the recommender system. These features should be ones that have some sort of variation between the different towns. If all towns have the same value for a feature, then how can we use that feature to make recommendations?</p>
                <p>One piece of analysis was on the type of establishments found in each town. We can find the proportion of an establishment category in a town by dividing the count for that category by the total number of establishments found in that town. This can be seen in the following image.</p>
                
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Map of Luxembourg" src="town_places_proportion.png" />
        		    <p>The establishment proportion for each establishment category, for each town in Luxembourg.</p>
        		</div>
                
                <h2>Recommender System</h2>
                <p>To create the recommender system I first need to extract some features. Area, population, latitude, and longitude were taken from the Wikipedia data. One-hot encoding was also used on the cantons of each town, for another locational feature. Establishment counts and establishment proportions for each top-level category were extracted for each town, using the Foursquare data. Overall, 32 features were extracted.</p>
                <p>A Euclidean distance matrix was then used to compare towns. Lower values in the matrix indicate more similarity between two towns.</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>The most similar town for each town in Luxembourg can be found in the following table.</p>
                <div class="captioned-image">
        		    <img alt="Luxembourg town similarity" src="similar-towns.png" width="75%"/>
        		    <p>The most similar town for each town in Luxembourg.</p>
        		</div>
                <p>If you analyse the table, it is possible to find four groupings. Each group can be categorised by locational and establishment data. For example, Echternach and Diekirch are both towns found in the east of Luxembourg with a low proportion of Shop & Service and Outdoors & Recreation establishments. Full descriptions of the groups can be found in my full report.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>There are twelve towns in Luxembourg that can be compared to each other based upon establishment data gathered from Foursquare and statistical data gathered from Wikipedia. By grouping establishment data into top-level categories, 32 features can be extracted to be used in a distance matrix with Euclidean distance. Four groupings can be made using the distance matrix. The first group is Echternach and Diekirch. The second group is Grevenmacher and Remich. The third group is Wiltz and Ettelbruck. The fourth group contains the remaining towns. Each of these groups can be identified by locational data and establishment category data.</p>
